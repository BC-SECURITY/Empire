description: "Modifies the Relative Identifier (RID) of an existing user account
  to grant it administrative \nprivileges by changing the RID value used to create
  access tokens. This technique allows \noperators to elevate a regular user account
  to have the same privileges as the built-in \nAdministrator account (RID 500) without
  modifying group memberships.\n\nRID hijacking is a sophisticated privilege escalation
  technique that works by directly \nmodifying the SAM database to change how Windows
  interprets user privileges. This approach \nbypasses traditional group-based access
  control and can be used to create hidden administrative \naccounts that appear
  as regular users to most security tools.\n\nThis technique requires administrative
  privileges to implement and creates persistent \nprivilege escalation that survives
  reboots and password changes.\n"
