description: "Executes commands on remote Linux/Unix systems over SSH using provided
  credentials \nor key-based authentication. This module allows operators to run
  arbitrary commands \nor Empire stagers on SSH-enabled hosts, making it especially
  useful for lateral \nmovement in mixed Windows/Linux environments.\n\nThe module
  supports both password-based and key-based authentication methods \nand can execute
  either single commands or transfer and execute more complex \nscripts. It operates
  over standard SSH ports (typically 22/TCP) and handles \ncommand output retrieval.\n\nSSH
  command execution is generally less suspicious than many Windows lateral \nmovement
  techniques as it uses legitimate administrative channels. However, \nSSH access
  may be logged by security monitoring systems, and failed authentication \nattempts
  can trigger lockouts or alerts.\n"
