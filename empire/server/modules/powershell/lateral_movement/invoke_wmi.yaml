description: "Executes PowerShell commands or Empire stagers on remote systems using
  Windows \nManagement Instrumentation (WMI). WMI offers a stealthier alternative
  to other \nlateral movement techniques like PsExec, as it doesn't require creating
  a service \non the target machine.\n\nThis module leverages the WMI Win32_Process
  class to create processes remotely \nand supports both plaintext credentials and
  pass-the-hash techniques for authentication. \nWMI execution typically only requires
  administrative privileges on the target \nand operates over standard DCOM/RPC ports
  (typically 135/TCP), making it effective \neven in environments with limited outbound
  connectivity.\n\nWhile WMI execution is more subtle than service-based techniques,
  modern EDR \nsolutions often monitor WMI activity for process creation events.
  This technique \nleaves artifacts in WMI event logs and process creation logs that
  can be detected \nby security monitoring systems specifically watching for this
  attack vector.\n"
