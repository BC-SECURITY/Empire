description: "Creates a dynamic port forwarding tunnel using the SSH protocol, allowing
  traffic \nto be redirected through an intermediary host to reach otherwise inaccessible
  \nnetwork segments. This module establishes a SOCKS proxy on the local system that
  \nroutes traffic through the SSH connection to the target.\n\nThis technique is
  particularly useful for pivoting through compromised hosts to \naccess isolated
  network segments, perform internal network reconnaissance, or \ninteract with services
  that are not directly accessible from the operator's position.\n\nThe module requires
  SSH credentials or key-based authentication to the intermediary \nhost. Once established,
  other tools can be configured to use the SOCKS proxy, \neffectively extending their
  reach into previously inaccessible network areas \nwithout requiring direct network
  connectivity.\n"
