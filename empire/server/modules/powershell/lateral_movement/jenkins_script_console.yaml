description: "Exploits the Jenkins Script Console feature to execute arbitrary Groovy/Java
  code \non Jenkins servers where the attacker has access to the console. This module
  allows \nfor command execution or Empire stager deployment through Jenkins' built-in
  scripting \nfunctionality.\n\nThe technique requires authenticated access to the
  Jenkins web interface with \nsufficient privileges to access the Script Console
  (typically admin privileges). \nOnce accessed, the console allows execution of
  Groovy scripts in the context of \nthe Jenkins server process, which typically
  runs with high privileges on the host.\n\nThis approach is particularly effective
  for targeting DevOps infrastructure, as \nJenkins servers often have extensive
  network access and trusted connections to \nother systems for CI/CD purposes. The
  module supports both direct command execution \nand downloading/executing files
  from remote sources.\n\nWhile Jenkins may log script console usage, many organizations
  don't actively monitor \nthese logs, making this technique relatively stealthy
  compared to endpoint-based \nexecution methods.\n"
