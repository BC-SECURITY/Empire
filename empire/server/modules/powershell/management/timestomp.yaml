description: "Executes time-stomp functionality by modifying file timestamps (MAC
  attributes) \nto manipulate forensic artifacts and evade timeline analysis. This
  module allows \noperators to alter the Modified, Accessed, and Created timestamps
  of files to \nblend malicious activities with legitimate system operations.\n\nTime-stomping
  is a critical anti-forensics technique that helps operators avoid \ndetection during
  post-incident analysis. By setting file timestamps to match \nlegitimate system
  files or historical dates, malicious files can appear to be \npart of normal system
  operations or pre-date the security incident.\n\nThe module can clone timestamps
  from existing files or set custom timestamps, \nproviding flexibility for different
  operational scenarios and forensic evasion \nrequirements.\n"
