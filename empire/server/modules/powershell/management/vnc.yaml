description: "Executes a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) agent in-memory to establish
  remote \ndesktop access to the target system. This module provides graphical user
  interface \naccess without requiring traditional VNC server installation or file
  system artifacts.\n\nThe VNC agent can operate in two modes: bind mode (listening
  on a local port) \nor reverse mode (connecting back to a specified IP address).
  This flexibility \nallows operators to work around network restrictions and firewall
  configurations.\n\nPassword authentication is supported to secure the VNC connection,
  and the \nin-memory execution helps evade detection by traditional endpoint protection
  \nsolutions that monitor for VNC server installations.\n"
