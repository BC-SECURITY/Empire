description: "Forces a system restart of the target machine using the native PowerShell
  \nRestart-Computer cmdlet. This module provides immediate system reboot capability
  \nfor operational requirements, system maintenance, or to clear volatile memory.\n\nSystem
  restarts are often necessary during post-exploitation activities to \nclear memory
  artifacts, reload system configurations, or ensure persistence \nmechanisms are
  properly activated. The forced restart bypasses user prompts \nand application
  blocking, ensuring the reboot occurs immediately.\n"
