description: "Executes commands or programs with alternate user credentials on the
  target system \nusing the Windows RunAs functionality. This module allows operators
  to run processes \nunder different user contexts without requiring a full login
  session, useful for \naccessing resources restricted to specific users.\n\nUnlike
  traditional privilege escalation, RunAs requires knowledge of valid credentials
  \nbut can provide access to network resources, applications, or data that may be
  \ninaccessible to the current user context. The module supports executing both
  simple \ncommands and full applications with command-line arguments.\n\nThe module
  creates visible process creation events that include the alternate user \ncontext,
  potentially alerting security monitoring systems to credential usage patterns.
  \nThe spawned process also operates with standard Windows authentication tokens
  rather \nthan trying to hide its identity.\n"
