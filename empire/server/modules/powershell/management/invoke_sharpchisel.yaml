description: "Establishes a reverse tunneling capability using SharpChisel, a C#
  implementation \nof the Chisel tunneling tool. This module creates encrypted tunnels
  between the \ncompromised system and attacker infrastructure, enabling access to
  otherwise \nunreachable network segments or services.\n\nThe tunnel operates over
  HTTP/HTTPS, allowing traffic to blend with legitimate \nweb traffic and bypass
  many firewall restrictions. SharpChisel supports various \ntunnel types including
  SOCKS proxies, remote port forwarding, and local port \nforwarding to adapt to
  different network pivoting requirements.\n\nThis technique is particularly valuable
  for accessing internal services from \nexternal positions, bypassing network segmentation,
  or establishing persistent \naccess channels that don't rely on the Empire agent
  itself. The module executes \nSharpChisel in memory using .NET reflection, avoiding
  disk writes that might \ntrigger file-based detections.\n\nThe encrypted nature
  of the tunnel helps evade deep packet inspection, though \nsustained connections
  to external servers may be flagged by network monitoring \ntools tracking long-lived
  sessions.\n"

  - 'This is the Chisel client loaded with reflection. A chisel server needs to be
    started before running this module. Only Chisel server v1.7.2 was tested with
    this module. Chisel server should be started like so: "./chisel server --reverse"'
