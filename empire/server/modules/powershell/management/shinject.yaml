description: "Injects Position Independent Code (PIC) shellcode payload into a target
  process \nusing the Invoke-Shellcode technique. This module allows operators to
  execute \narbitrary shellcode within the context of an existing process, bypassing
  \ntraditional process creation monitoring.\n\nShellcode injection is a sophisticated
  technique that loads and executes \nmachine code directly in memory without creating
  files on disk. This approach \nhelps evade file-based detection mechanisms and
  allows operators to run \ncustom payloads within trusted processes.\n\nThe module
  supports injection into both 32-bit and 64-bit processes, with \nautomatic architecture
  detection. This capability is essential for executing \ncustom tools, establishing
  persistence mechanisms, or running specialized \npayloads that require direct memory
  execution.\n"
