description: "Executes arbitrary DLLs in memory using reflective injection techniques
  without \ntouching the disk or using the standard Windows loader. This module allows
  operators \nto load and execute compiled tools directly into process memory, bypassing
  file-based \ndetection mechanisms.\n\nReflective injection works by implementing
  a custom PE loader that handles memory \nallocation, imports resolution, and relocation
  fixing, enabling a DLL to load itself \ninto memory from a raw byte array rather
  than from disk. This allows sophisticated \npost-exploitation tools to run without
  creating filesystem artifacts.\n\nThe module supports injecting into the current
  process or a remote process, allowing \noperators to hide malicious activity under
  legitimate processes. It can execute both \ncustom and standard DLLs with export
  functions.\n"
