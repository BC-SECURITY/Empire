description: "Converts a specified domain\\username to its corresponding Security
  Identifier (SID). \nThis module performs user account enumeration and identity
  resolution by translating \nhuman-readable usernames into their unique Windows
  security identifiers.\n\nSIDs are fundamental to Windows security architecture
  and are used throughout \nthe operating system for access control, group membership,
  and security auditing. \nThis conversion is essential for understanding user permissions,
  group memberships, \nand security relationships within Active Directory environments.\n\nThe
  module supports both local and domain user accounts, providing operators \nwith
  the ability to map user identities to their underlying security principals \nfor
  reconnaissance and privilege escalation activities.\n"
