description: "Logs off the current user or all users from the target machine. This
  module \nprovides the ability to terminate user sessions, forcing users to log
  off \ninteractively or remotely.\n\nLogging off users can be useful for operational
  security, clearing active \nsessions, or preparing a system for further exploitation
  or cleanup. The \nmodule supports logging off a single user (the session running
  the agent) \nor all users currently logged into the system.\n\nThis capability
  is often used to disrupt user activity, clear evidence, or \nensure that only authorized
  sessions remain active during post-exploitation \noperations.\n"
