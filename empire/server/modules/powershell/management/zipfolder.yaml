description: "Compresses a target folder into a ZIP archive for efficient data exfiltration
  \nand storage. This module creates compressed archives of directories to reduce
  \ntransfer size and organize collected data for later analysis.\n\nThe compression
  process uses native Windows COM objects to create ZIP files \nwithout requiring
  external compression utilities. This approach ensures \ncompatibility across different
  Windows environments and reduces the footprint \nof data collection activities.\n\nZIP
  archives are commonly used in data exfiltration scenarios to package \nmultiple
  files and directories into a single transferable file, making it \neasier to move
  large amounts of data while maintaining directory structure \nand reducing network
  bandwidth requirements.\n"
